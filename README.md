# dart-telegram-bot-api
My attempt to create an interface to the Telegram Bot API

This project is a port of the [Yagop's node-telegram-bot-api](https://github.com/yagop/node-telegram-bot-api/), with almost all methods and features, but built entirely in Dart.

__This is a very WIP project, and nothing on it is currently usable.__
